Demo: Show techniques for deploying environment variables and secrets, 
how to reference a secret from an environment variable as well as passing to a Docker image

It is easy to set environment variables on an application.  You can do it at the time of 
creation via oc new-app, or you can even set an environment variable after an application
has already been created.

For example, to pass environment variables to the MongoDB Docker image =>

In order to pass secret environment variables to a Docker image (or any imagestream) at the 
time of creation, you must use a DeploymentConfig file.

Passing Secrets to a Docker Image =>

1.  Create secret for SA_PASSWORD
oc create secret generic sql-server-sa-password-secret --from-literal=SA_PASSWORD=Password!23

2.  Import the image (if not already there)
oc import-image mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest-ubuntu --confirm

3.  Deployment Configuration
oc apply -f .\mongo-deployment-config.json

MongoDB Connection String Secrets
oc set env dc/data-seeder --from secret/mongo-db
oc set env dc/workshop-api --from secret/mongo-db
